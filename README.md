## Motivation

Smartphones have become so ubiquitous in our lives that we carry them everywhere in our pockets. We rely on phones to conduct everyday tasks, such as tracking our health. Phones today are able to count steps, measure running/walking distance, and even evaluate gait symmetry. This project aims to take the level of health tracking a step further. Imagine that you are on the threadmill. You turn the slope on high to really burn those quads, but the phone in your pocket is only counting steps as if you are walking on flat ground. That's not very satisfying. Your phone should be able to accurately track how hard you worked by accounting for walking slope. So that what we set out to do. In this project, we propose a machine learning model to predict ground slope using phone accelometer and gyroscope data.
